Friday is always special. As always the day started with working on Figma. Was still working on how to make the interface uniform and appealing. I was working on the font size first. Accommodating the already designed ones with larger fonts were done. Then the back buttons were removed and replaced with interactions. I gave the interaction Drag so that if they drag the screen, the back option is triggered. The background images were changed. Earlier each page had a different image which had a similar feel of the interface. I changed it into a uniform one. Later I had to go for prayer since it was Friday. I informed Kalyan and left for the prayer. Got back and had lunch which was followed by Rexilia’s session on Html.

Rexilia taught us how to make a .css file and the uses of it. She explained where and when such a .css file was used and the advantages of using it. Firstly a folder needs to be created say stylesheet within which a .css file needs to be made. Whatever designs and style needed can be coded in the .css file. This file is separate and independent. Hence, wherever we require such a design or style, we need not code for the design or style completely from the beginning. Instead the .css file can be called and that specific design could be given there. Thus, we can make this useful by creating a variety of .css file for various different styles, designs etc.

Haridev had a presentation about networking. He covered almost all basic topics including all the topologies, types of networks, identifiers, criterias to be met by computer networking etc. He also included various protocols followed in networking along with the types of different protocols. He added advantages and disadvantages of different types of networking as well as topologies.

The next session was by Askin. Today he came up with an interesting topic: “Obsession”. It was really a subjective topic. What was obsession, what could cause obsession, why do we need and why we don’t need an obsession were all talked about. Numerous questions were raised and all questions were answered. The point he wanted to make was that everyone must have an obsession and that obsession must help grow in all phases. Obsession if rightly nurtured will prove to be the root cause of our success in whatever aspects we are fond of. Secondly he talked about the continuation of the previous class which was algorithms. He had assigned groups and each group was assigned a task. That task was displayed. All of us wrote down the respective tasks algorithms.

The final session for the day was taken up by Anoop. He was the head of content writing and hence he gave us a small session on how to do a presentation. He gave us a few tips to make our presentations wonderful and worth listening to. Firstly he commented about how the presentations that were presented earlier were. How he felt and what all could be improved for the coming ones. He asked everyone to concentrate majorly on two things. One was the subject knowledge or how much we know the topic. The second was understanding the audience. Understanding the audience includes knowing how much knowledge the audience might have about the topic, expecting the question that could rise and most importantly not including or talking about things you are not thorough about. That was a game changing statement for me. He said that if you are confident enough to answer a question that comes from a topic that you don’t know or know very little about, better not go nowhere near it. He also mentioned that we need to do a good research on the topic before we give one presentation. This will help us know what to talk, what not to talk, how to talk and how not to. There might be audiences that might get offended. So it is necessary to do research about the topic.
