Friday, the last day of the week went completely packed with sessions. In the morning, I started working on the third page of my figma design which was the 4 wheeler search profile. A new directory named Profile_page was created within which all the pages related to profiles will be coded and saved. A new class named ProfilePage was made in order to read it from the main.dart file. The current page was named “4wheelerprofile_page.dart”. The page consisted of a background image, a text container and the profile container within which 7 other containers are enclosed. Hence, coding for them will not be an easy task. I started with the import.asset command for importing the image exported from figma unsplashed. Secondly, the top most heading container was made which had a text “4-wheeler ZErider x3”. The color was given grey with an opacity of 50% and the texts were made bold with alignment in the center. Next was the profile container. Kalyan asked me to only create and design the external container which encloses the rest of the containers after which he will teach me how to create the rest of the containers in an easier method. Therefore I created the external profile container with grey filled inside with an opacity of 50% and stroke border.

Rahul had a presentation about his application overview. His application was on waste management and collection. Initially, he developed an idea that collects garbage and other waste from door steps. India produces around 62 million tons of waste annually among which only 12 million tonnes are treated and 31 million tonnes are dumped in landfill sites. Hence, it was something to be looked into in a serious manner. The idea was collection of waste upon intimidation through the application. This could be either via text or over phone. The people who register in the app can let the app know any kind of waste at any location for which an innovative idea was brought up. The idea was a credit system which increases with every garbage disposal or intimidation they make. Hence, this could provide a motive to people to dispose of the garbage in the right manner. The credits earned through this could be made useful in many ways. In the bigger picture, they could use the credits to have discount coupons on various purchases online. Other than that, it could be made to get discounts on railway tickets, air tickets and other public transportations if collaborated with the government.

The waste collected in bulk is taken to large treatment plants where these garbage are separated into various categories and then treated accordingly. Instead of disposing in large landfills, the garbage could be either recycled or even reused through proper treatment. The major advantages of this is that it helps to keep the environment and surroundings clean. In a longer term, if the environment is cleaner, the people’s lives could be made healthier and a healthier people in turn contributes to a healthier society. Other advantages include reducing communicable diseases such as malaria, dengue which are caused by mosquitoes and houseflies. Apart from that the overall waste disposed properly in the right scientific manner could be increased on a large scale. The disadvantages of the idea proposed is that it requires enormous funding to back the whole process up properly. Moreover huge labour is in the game. Hence, apt payment must be availed to them in order to function.

The second part of the day was taken by Koushik. He took the continuation of the previous day’s session on Data Types and Computing language. The various types of Datatypes are double, float, undefined, int, string, char, null and Boolean. The whole method of computing includes the first stage which is Input, the second stage which includes memory and process and the third stage which is output. Similarly, every computing language has its own keywords like Java has int, float, short, double, char, string etc. Just like keywords, every language has its own syntax and functions. The function works in two ways- declaration and execution.
