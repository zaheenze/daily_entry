Today was one big day for me. I had my presentation ready for the day. Day started off with the breakfast that was idli. I was working over figma since morning though I had to prepare for the presentation. By 12pm, Kalyan asked me to attend a meeting which was held on the second floor. I reached there on time. Almost everyone working on various projects and departments were present in the meeting. It was said that every Monday that was the first day after the week off they hold such a meeting to plan the tasks for the week. The meeting had agendas over all the three projects that the company was working on. Hopeww, Term and Reducation were these three projects. Kalyan, Joel, Ernest, Thabita, Arul, Rexy, Jaswanth, Thiyagua and Askin were present in the meeting.

Basically the meeting was to let each other know how much or to what extent they have achieved their tasks and whether there was a delay or not. Hopeww or Hope world-wide was the first project discussed. Hopeww is a platform built to receive donations from all over the world. Donations could be for any circumstances. Say a person was suddenly diagnosed with kidney failure and had to undergo dialysis. Due to this, his or her financial condition dropped down and was leading a miserable life. Hence, he or she can approach Hopeww to ask for a donation understanding her situation. She could ask for donations to start a small scale business and people convinced can lend her a hand via Hopeww. Coming to the discussion, they had few issues in converting the donation from dollar and sck. That was almost solved. They had designed a better version of the dashboard which was bug free.

Secondly, Term was the project discussed. Term happened to be a platform to help entrepreneurs grow if they come up with innovative and creative ideas. Hence, people with such interest can approach Term to fund their startups. These idea makers or to become entrepreneurs must undergo training under Term before they start accepting donations. Now the project also had few issues to be dealt with and everyone presented their part of the meeting along with the work they will do for the week.

Thirdly, Reducated is a project which funds students of great interest to study and who are held back due to their financial condition. Basically all three projects had the same core goal which was to help someone suffering in this world and provide them with whatever we could. Similarly, Reducated focused on education right from the kindergarden. They completed the mentor and mentee portion of the app where both of them had different profiles and various levels of access in the application.

By the time the meeting had ended, it was time for lunch. Immediately after lunch, we had a session by Koushik. This time the session was how to understand problems with no solution. He mentioned that before blindly approaching a problem to fix it or find a solution to it, we must try to understand whether it really has a solution or not. Else it will be an utter waste of our time and effort as well. Eulers formula was also brought into the session to explain how a problem can have no solution.

After the session, I went back upstairs to the third floor to get back to my work. I went through the presentation once again to cross check whether there have been any unknown mistakes. It really did work because I did find minute mistakes. By 5pm, Kalyan informed everyone that I was going to a presenation today and everyone must reach the second floor by 5:30pm.

Everyone gathered on the second floor for my presentation. Kalyan connected the laptop to the TV screen. When it was good to start, I began my presentation. It was not bad though the topic wasn’t of great knowledge to me, I managed to explain almost all the basics of SDLC to all the people. I explained about all 7 stages of SDLC. Along with that all other models that were being followed were explained including its drawbacks. After the presentation, there was a question-answer session held. Anyone could ask questions about SDLC and it was my responsibility to clear and make them understand. Askin, Pooja, Jaswanth, Anoop and Abraham anna itself came up with a few brain twisting questions. Though I made a few blunders, I did manage to cover my footprints without compromising the presentation. I was given an applause in the end.

Next came Koushik’s session on the Linux terminal. We were taught how to create a .md file. How we could use fonts and change size of fonts was told. We were asked to try on our own laptops. Each of us were asked to create different font sized .md files and push to github. By the time I had completed that task of pushing the file, it was around 6:30PM. By 7, we left the office too.
