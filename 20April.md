The second day working on the project, we encountered plenty of issues regarding the designs. When consulted with Alan, he gave numerous suggestions on how to make the interface far better. Moreover, he gave a brief idea about Human Interface Guidelines and Information Architecture basics. We started with the flutter part of the design that is the login page.

Initially a new flutter project was created with the name “newproject” within which a folder “pages” was created. The “pages” folder was in which various pages like login page, signup page etc. were to be included. The first step was to import the packages and then change the scaffold color to black. Then a container was made within which the rest of the other things were to be stacked.

Later by 4pm, Ernest gave us a session on flutter itself. He introduced the very basics of flutter. He explained how and what flutter was. He suggested methods to recollect the ideology behind flutter while coding. Basically, Flutter is all about widgets and coding on flutter is more or less similar to building or stacking widgets one over the other. He covered the basics like what import package:flutter was, what material.dart was, void main, Stateless widget, widget build etc.

Package:flutter are the contributions by other developers to the flutter and dart ecosystem which allows the users and developers to quickly build an app without having to develop from the very scratch. Material.dart is the package we are importing for our convenience with the help of which we will be working on further. Void.main is the return type of the function which executes all the codes inside. Stateless widgets are the widgets that don’t change, that is they are immutable. Its appearance and properties remain unchanged throughout the lifetime of the widget. In simple words, Stateless widgets cannot change their state during the runtime of the app, which means the widgets cannot be redrawn while the app is in action.  At the same time, there are Stateful Widgets too. They are the ones that change their properties during run-time. They are dynamic, that is they are mutable and can be drawn multiple times within its lifetime. It can change its appearance in response to events triggered by user interactions or when it receives data.

Then Ernest came down to the very basic widgets such as Containers, Row, Column, Center, child, children, body, decoration etc. The fluency in flutter is based upon how well each widget is used and shaped in the code. Containers serve the major part in the same. Child and children were explained. When a widget is placed within a widget, the outer widget serves as a parent and if only one widget is placed inside, the inner widget serves as a child. At the same time, if more than one widget is placed within another widget, the outer one serves as a parent and the rest of them are classified as children. For example, if a text is to be given inside a container, the container serves as the parent widget and the text as its child. At the same time, if an image and text is to be added inside the container, the text and the image are considered as children.
