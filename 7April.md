 little easier day by day. I felt it was complicated but enjoyable at the same time. Today, the major part of the day was taken up by the session. In the morning, I worked on flutter and from noon, we had packed sessions. One was by the CTO Mr. Abraham and second was by Koushik.

In the morning, I worked on the second page itself. I had to give a border to the circular container. This was given with the Border property. The width of the border must be given within the property. The code looks like:

Border:Border.all(width:2)

This will give a border to the container with a width or thickness of 2.

Next there were icons to be fixed within the text box. The icons were of a bike and a car. Kalyan asked me to go through google icons to find the perfect ones. In addition, the google icon’s had an advantage that we could get the flutter code of the icon. That was something really interesting for me. What messes up more is finding errors in the terminal. Most of the issue I face is either due to unclosed brackets or somewhere I make inappropriate child or children class. The problem faced while getting icons was the brackets within the row. Took a lot of time figuring out the extra brackets and the missed out ones. Kalyan also helped me with the same. Then he asked me to list down the pages and folders to which they must be sent within the terminal. A total of five folders- Login page, Home page, Plan page, Profile Page and Confirmation page. Before moving to the next page, he asked me to go through the Item Builder widget which was necessary in the next page. Basically itemBuilder widget is used to create lists that display different types of content. For example, you might be working on a list that shows a heading followed by a few items related to the heading, followed by another heading, and so on. The code looks like:

itemBuilder:(Context,index) {

return Text(‘ ‘);

}

In the afternoon, the first part taken by CTO Mr. Abraham was the continuation of the previous day. The conclusions he concluded yesterday were:

1. Everything or every single data is turned into numbers.

2. Programming language is for us to understand.

He explained about the two major data types. One was the Primitive Data types and the second was the Composite Data types.  Those which fall under primitive data types are:

1. String

2. Numbers

3. Boolean

4. Null

Composite Data type is a mix of data types. Hence, those which fall under this type are:

1. List/ Array

2. Object/ Maps/ Sets

3. Functions.

The need of the programming language was to make a mutual operational format between humans and computers. Thus, for more convenience and operations.

N number of ways can be found to do a task and if this is reflected in the case of computing, a total dilemma will be created. Hence, this was the necessity of a programming language to come up. A language that anyone can learn in order to make the computer do whatever is required. Moreover there are a lot of programming languages out there. These were made in order to make something or the other that was difficult in the previous one easier. Hence, all computing languages will have their own advantages and disadvantages as well. To sum up, a computing language was introduced due to the necessity to teach or instruct the computer to work in the various required ways.

The second part taken by Koushik was on the language English itself. If the English language is categorized as a whole, we can see that it can be categorized into symbols, words or tokens and expressions. Those which fall under each of them are:

Symbols:

1. A to Z

2. a to z

3. 0 to 9

4. Special characters

5. Spacing

Words/ Tokens:

Collection of symbols

Expression:

Collection of tokens

In case of any language or be it the computing language to be specific, it undergoes certain checks in order to make sure whether the language syntax or rules are right or wrong. In other words, generally there are three checks to pass before any language is written or conversed. These are:

1. Lexical Analysis

2. Syntax Analysis

3. Semantic Analysis

These three checks are called Compilers. Hence, any fault or uncheck in any of these three will result in an error in that respective language. Same is in the case of computing language too. If we look through the history of coding or computing language, we can see that the codes were written down in a paper which only consisted of 0s and 1s. For example: 1010101011

The computing language can be classified broadly into two- Assembly Level Language and High Level Language. The assembly level language is where SUB, ADD, DIV, MUL, ++ etc. fall under. Whereas languages like Java, C++, Python and all fall under High level languages.

If the computing language as a whole is categorized, it can be divided into two-Symbols and Tokens. The UNICODE falls under the symbols whereas punctuations, identifiers, numerical values, string literal, operators and keywords fall under tokens.

Apart from the session, Koushik asked us to create our own language with a syntax of our own. This was given as a task to complete before the coming Monday. The rules layout were as follows:

1. What are accepted symbols?

2. What are tokens?

3. What is a valid expression? How are tokens separate from expression?

4. How does an expression start and end?

5. What does a collective group of expressions look like?

6. What are the syntax rules?

7. How does mathematical operation work?
