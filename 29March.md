The day started with figma completion itself. I still feel like there is something missing in the design I have made. At 10:15AM, there was the morning session. Koushik was the one upfront. The topic for the morning session was Propositional statements. Basically propositional sentences or statements are a set of statements that might be true or false. More or like sentences that can be connected to each other in some form from the set of sentences. For example:

1. The sun makes things warm where it shines.

2. My car is outside in the sun.

3. My car is warm.

Among these sentences, the first sentence is true. At the same time, the first sentence is also a universal truth. Hence, it can never be false. The second and third sentence are conditional. Whether it is true or false depends upon the first sentence. Thus, since the first one is universally true, the rest of the sentences also happens to be true. If first sentence is not taken into consideration, the second and third sentence has a chance of being either true or false. So such sentences are combinations of proposition related to each other’s properties. Moreover the truth of one statement influences the other.

The next topic for the session was Variables and Connectors. In short, it was the connecting words that connects two or more sentences and the negation of sentences. For example, the negation of the sentence “He is a brilliant student” is “He is not a brilliant student”. This could also be called Logical Not for the sentence. Say when two sentences happened to be true, they could easily be connected with the word “And”. For example:

1. The sun cause the daylight.

2. The sun makes the day warm.

Hence, the sentence can be connected by adding and like “The sun cause the daylight and the sun makes the day warm”. This is because both the sentences are true. In case if any of the sentence is false, we will have to go for “Or”. For example:

1. The food tasted bad.

2. I have a bad sense of taste.

Hence, the sentence could be written as “The food tasted bad or I have a bad sense of taste”. This was since the second sentence could either be true or false.

The session ended and I got back working on the figma designs. I was finding ways to bring up more ideas and features into the design. Then after a while, I started to go through the basics of Flutter. I installed Android studio to develop applications via flutter. But I found difficulty in the terminal installation since I worked on my laptop. I asked for help and Abin happily helped me. I disturbed him more than thrice but he did help me out without any irritation. Finally all the apps- Flutter, Android studio and Vim in the terminal were installed.

Lunch was served after which we had another session. It was taken by Rexy on html. Html has always been familiar but never got to know about it like this. Html sounded something easy but Hypertext Markup Language did sound complicated and it was. We were taught how to make a header and body.

We were asked to give a heading for the page first. Then we were asked to give a title. How to write a paragraph, how to give different fonts to the text plus bond, italic and underlining was followed. Then we were told how to add color to the background as well as texts. Highlighting the text was also mentioned. We were told how to add a “click here” button which when clicked could redirect us into another page or website.

The session got over and then I completely started learning the basics of flutter. The flutter widgets were started and I came across plenty. Stateless and Stateful widgets were where I began. First was understanding the state of a widget. The state of the widget happened to be the information of the object that its properties are holding at the time of creation. Stateless widgets are the widgets that don’t change its appearance and properties throughout even during the run time of the application whereas stateful widgets are those widgets that change its appearance or properties in response to the user. This response could be anything. It could be any kind of trigger or even a series of events.

Kalyan then started explaining about classes, its functions and its necessity which was followed by the use of child and children.
