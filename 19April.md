From today, hardly two weeks are left for the internship to end. Now the two weeks that are remaining is to be completely worked on the project assigned. The whole batch was split into two with each team consisting of five members. The project of ours was to create an application as well as a website that works more or less similar to spelling bee.

The computer gives us a random word from the whole dictionary. The word is to be given in the form of an audio. Once the word is given in an audio form, the word spelled out is to be typed in the application or website. The word must be cross checked and to be verified whether it is right or wrong. The dictionary is to be classified into two categories. One is beginner level where the words are of three letters and then the intermediate level which is of four or more letters. This was the entire outline of the project given to us.

Today being the very first day working together on the project, the first task initiated was to create a wireframe for the design. All five of us came down to the second floor and sat together. Every opinion of every single person was taken into consideration. We split the work into two as a whole. The former was a team for the mobile application and the latter was the website. To develop the mobile application, flutter was to be known whereas to work on the website, html, .css and firebase is to be known. Therefore I and Ashein took responsibility for the flutter part and the rest of the three- Haridev, Neelkandan and Joshua took responsibility for website handling.

We had a session at 11am by Mr. Gokul who was basically a chartered accountant and a friend of Mr. Abraham. He happened to visit the office for some reason and on Mr. Abraham’s request, he took over a few minutes of ours to share his views on Financial Management. It was one of the most interesting sessions I came across during the entire session. He talked about how he was an average student throughout his learning career starting from schooling to his college and CA. He shared how important it is to manage money, our spending on wanted and unwanted, necessity and unnecessary ones and all. He gave a small idea on how education and money go hand in hand. He later mentioned the necessary matters that are to be taken into concern during our age. In major, he mentioned three things. One was life insurance and the second was 10-15% savings. Life insurance which was taken foremost was stressed by him to be taken into account by each one of us. A life insurance that not only covers our health but also our parents too. In today’s era, hospitals have been an everyday scenario due to enormous pathogens, diseases and to be precise the lifestyle too. Hence, that happens to be taken into account with utmost need. Secondly was the savings part. He elaborated the savings scheme he mentioned earlier. Since all of the dais were employees, a part of the monthly salary is to be kept aside irrespective of the expenditure we have. This will pave the path towards our retirement in a very good manner. The scheme he asked us to follow was that 10 to 15% of the salary must be kept aside as savings after which we need to manage the money accordingly. A question and answer session also took place meanwhile where he interacted with various employees and gave his personal suggestion to the question of theirs.

After which we came back down to get back with the discussion on the project. I started the figma designing based on the wireframe that were put during the discussion.
